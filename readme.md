# react-weather

The classic weather app built with React.

## How to run

This is a React app created with Vite, which makes it simple to clone and run locally. Once cloned, install the dependencies with `npm i` and run the project locally with `npm run dev`. 

## To do

* When the user types, clear any weather cards
* Style everything else
* Add a photo credit

## Nice to have

* Add the option to change between celius and fahrenheit
* React Router, about page
* Set the image based on the user's location, or, if user location isn't available, the user's last search
