# react-weather

The classic weather app built with React.

## To do

* On search, populate a list as the user types 
* The user clicks on the desired city
* Use the lat-long city data to search that specific city
* Clear search on no text
* Add an input that is linked to app state
* Work out what data I need to bring in and from where

## Nice to have

* Set the background image based on the weather at the user's location
